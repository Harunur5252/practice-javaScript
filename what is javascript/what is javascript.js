 JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement
 complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit
 there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely 
 content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video 
 jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. 
 It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, 
 two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other 
 parts of the Learning Area.
 Basically user interection, any events and for more interactive used javaScript.
 By default js browser understand

 ### Scope of JavaScript 
    1. Client side javaScript(Browser)->Client side javascript works with Html.
    2. server side javaScript(Node js) // help js to run out of the browser
    you can do anything that a modern language can do 
    (web application,mobile application,desktop application, games development, Ml/AI)

    ### Javascript is a scripting or programming language??
      Ans : All scripting language are programming language.
      the theoretical difference between the two is that scripting language do not require the compilation/trasnpilation
      and programming language require.

      ***  compiled/transpilation means computer readable
      ***  javascript is both interpreted and compiled(JIT).
      ***  Also interpretation means computer readable.so, readable way is two types
           1. compiled/transpilation(without scripting language)
           2. interpretation(scripting language)

      *** javascript is high lavel programming language.
          we write code that is human readable but computer takes codes as a machine code. 
          v8(Javascript enginee for chrome) chakra(Javascript enginee for internet explorar) spider monkey(Javascript enginee for google firefox)-> you can say it browser that convert a human readable code to machine code.
           
          and follow some rules when to convert machine code that is Ecmascript specification.
      *** Ecmascript specification??
          It is some of rules how jacascript should work. you can say javascript is a Ecmascript because javascript follow Ecmascript specifications.

     *** JavaScript official name is Ecmascript.
