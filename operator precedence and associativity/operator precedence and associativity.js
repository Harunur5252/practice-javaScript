// operator precedence : that means which operator will work before or after.
// associativity : If precedence is same than check associativity for which part work first or last.
// see mdn for practice


console.log((1+1))
console.log((1+1)*10/10) // here () operator will work before(it's value 21) and * operator value is 15 so, () work first.
console.log((1+1)*[10/10])
