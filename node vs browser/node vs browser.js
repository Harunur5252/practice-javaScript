  two way run javaScript code one is browser for client side and another is node for server side
  what is the benefit using this??

    answer : when you use code editor then you can see the instance output using node js(Quokka js) and node js is support compiled engine(like v8 engine) to convert 
    machine code like a browser. But if you want to deal dom(document object model) and localStorage then you have to use a browser.
   

    ** Browser : Browser has also the specific feature that is dom and with compiled engine(like v8 engine) that convert a code to machine code. 
       browser will show only content.this is not a javascript part. If you want attach javaSCript to browser then use js with a Html file.
